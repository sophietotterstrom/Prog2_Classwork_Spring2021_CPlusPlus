Second programming class at Tampere Uni in C++. Classwork done with Qt Creator.

Class focused on a larger variety of problems. I learned syntax of C++, data structures (vectors, maps, structs, arrays, etc.), Object Oriented Programming, Pointers, Memory Management, GUI, File IO, Git Version Control, and more.
